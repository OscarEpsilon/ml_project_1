1,Music Recording and Performance,Arts or Computers 1,"Music exists as two separate artforms. On the one hand, music as it has traditionally existed is a fleeting performance art; the music exists only through its performance, similar to how a poem is meant to be read aloud, and does not exist on the page. In the late 1800’s, however, it became possible to record sounds through mechanical means, and play back the same recording over and over. In the 20th century, electronic instruments and advanced recording techniques brought about an era where music has more in common with sculpture than poetry; a piece of music is honed and perfected, with each shift in timbre and rhythm intentional and precise. This course will examine the duality of recorded and performed music, and students will learn to play music live as well as to record live instruments or create them from pure technological manipulation to create songs in a studio setting.

26,Reading Queerly,English 2,"In this literature class, we will explore not only novels written by and about the LGBTQ+ community, but also the experiences, cultures, histories, and politics that influence those stories.

29,The Language of Shakespeare,English 2,"Reading the plays of William Shakespeare, who is generally thought of as the most significant English writer of all time, is practically a high school rite of passage. Although his language may seem stilted and unfamiliar to the ears of some young readers, because Shakespeare’s plots and themes transcend human experience, many argue that his writing remains fundamentally accessible across history. On the other hand, some historical linguists suggest that Shakespeare lovers of all kinds miss many more of his basic meanings than they probably realize. There is no disputing that Shakespeare had an outsized impact on the English language, itself a massive influencer in global communication. However, language changes quickly and constantly! This course will involve a lot of literary analysis (exploring some of Shakespeare’s plays and poems, including Macbeth), but it will also incorporate some historical linguistics (etymology, syntax, etc.) as we work to address the EQ: "
30,The Art of the Argument,Honors English,"Aristotle tells us that “rhetoric is the ability to discover in each particular case all the available means of persuasion,” and the ancient Greeks believed that whomever was not a student of rhetoric would be a victim of it.

Gothic literature tends to challenge normal categories by creating characters, settings, or events that exist in the gray areas between two seemingly opposite groups, such as human/inhuman, living/dead, familiar/unfamiliar, holy/demonic, or self/other. In rejecting standard categories, Gothic texts almost always act as social commentary about the culture that creates them.

37,Sociology & Science Fiction,Social Studies or English 1/2,"Science fiction is often associated with fantastical technologies and funny looking alien species, but a common theme throughout much of science fiction is the exploration of various social constructs and ideologies. Through the construction of invented or adjusted realities, writers can contemplate through fiction what thinkers like Marx, Durkheim, Keynes, and Hayek wrote in response to the changing landscape of their times.

How did this moment come about, and what did it lead to? In this course, we will seek to answer these questions by reading and discussing "
73,Game Theory in Government,Government 1/2,"Arms races between superpowers or local rival nations offer an interesting look at strategic thinking. Both countries are better off when they cooperate and avoid an arms race. Yet the dominant strategy for each is to arm itself heavily. This example of “The Prisoner’s Dilemma” is just one facet of game theory, the formal study of strategic decision making, of strategy and conflict–something we see in governmental decisions time and again. The application of game theory to political science is focused in the overlapping areas of fair division, political economy, public choice, war bargaining, positive political theory, and social choice theory. In this class, we will study the concepts and philosophy of game theory, and their applications as used in political situations across time. EQ: "
74,Sociology & Science Fiction,Social Studies or English 1/2,"Science fiction is often associated with fantastical technologies and funny looking alien species, but a common theme throughout much of science fiction is the exploration of various social constructs and ideologies. By constructing invented or adjusted realities, writers can contemplate through fiction what thinkers like Marx, Durkheim, Keynes, and Hayek wrote in response to the changing landscape of their times. In both cases, thinkers diagnose the diseases of society and prognosticate their ultimate and inevitable outcome. This course will study these prognostications, focusing on how science fiction reflects the ideas of great sociological thinkers."
75,Classical Hollywood,"English, Social Studies, or Arts 1","Classical Hollywood was a glorious time in the movie industry. But do you know anything about classical Hollywood? Would you like to know more? We will watch a variety of movies made between the 1930s and 1960s and reflect on what they are about, how they can explain and discuss the period in which they were made, and why they are important.
